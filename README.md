# Lua Comment Cleaner

`lua-comment-cleaner` is a Python script that removes single-line and multi-line comments from Lua files while preserving the code structure and indentation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `clean_comments.py` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiNaSoR/lua-comment-cleaner.git
```

2. Place the `clean_comments.py` script in the same directory as the Lua file you want to clean.

3. Run the script, specifying the input Lua file and the output file.

```bash
python clean_comments.py input.lua output.lua
```

Replace `input.lua` with the name of your Lua file and `output.lua` with the desired output file name.
